Friday is a Ai assistant who takes command with your voice. As a matter of fact i have created this Pgm for the marvel iron-man fans, it does many command features which is controlled by your voice(cool huh?).for the most crazy part you can control your pc with your voice and make your personal desktop assistant do the job. it is not the best compared to alexa,cortana etc. but it is your self made assistant so be proud. 

# Requirements
'pip install -r requirements' 

# Facts
you can change the voice of the assistant by changing [0] to [1], here:- engine.setProperty('voice', voices[0].id),
you can send email to different people by just saying there name, ALERT:- i have not included the code for this, however, you can do this by yourself by adding dictionary (take it as a challenge).
in future i will add more features to it. :-]
please keep in mind that for sending email you have to turn on less secure app access in gmail settings.
If any ideas or errors feel free to post it in the issues.
